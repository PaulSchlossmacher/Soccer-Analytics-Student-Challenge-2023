# Soccer Analytics Student Challenge 2023

This is a project we did as a team of two for a soccer analytics competition at ETH ZÃ¼rich. The competition revolved around analysing differences between men's and women's football games.
We used mainly Python, but also R and Knime to do our analysis.

## Goal

The goal was to build a model that classifies whether a given game was played by men or women. However, the catch is that we were not allowed to use any variables that could be explained through physical differences between male and female players.
We therefore had to use differences in the tactics or the general playing style.

## Data

To train and test the model, we used the StatsBomb World Cup data, which is publically available (https://github.com/statsbomb/open-data).

## Results - Overview

The main part of this project were the models we developed to distinguish between men's and women's games. However, we also briefly looked into time wasting.
While it was not an important variable for our final model, the results of our analysis there were also interesting on their own.

The code and report for our models can respectively be found under:

The code and results for the time wasting part of the project can be found under:
